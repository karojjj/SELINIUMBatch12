Selenium Class 4
CSS SELECTOR: (Cascading Style Sheet)==>it is another way to locating elements on the web page.
Identifies web elements based on html structure
Syntax==>    tagname[attribute='attribute value']
facebook example for login ;
button[type='submit']
========================================================================================================================
++CSS does not give an opportunity to locate the element by its text
========================================================================================================================
shortcuts for CSS:

SHORTCUT FOR CLASSNAME==> "."
Syntax==> tagname.classNameValue
example==> input.button
========================================================================================================================
Shortcut for ID ==> "#"
Syntax==> tagname#IDValue
example==> input#twotabsearchtextbox
========================================================================================================================
Contains() method in CSS:
*(star) symbol represents contains method
Syntax ==> tagname[attribute *='attribute value']
Example : input[placeholder *='Email or phone number']
========================================================================================================================
starts-with method in CSS:
^(Circumflex) symbol represents starts with method
Syntax ==> tagname[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value']
Example==>      input[type ^='pass']
========================================================================================================================
ends-with method in CSS:
$ symbol represents ends-with method in CSS
Syntax==> tagname[attribute $= 'ending attribute value']
img[src $= 'syntax.png']
==========================what is difference between  CSS and XPATH?===================================================
The primary difference between XPath and CSS selectors is that with the XPath we can traverse both forward and
backward, whereas a CSS selector only moves forward.XPath enables bidirectional flow, meaning the traversal may go
both ways â€“ from child to parent and parent to child. On the contrary, CSS enables one-directional flow, so the
traversal works only from parent to child. Concerning speed and performance, XPath is slower, and CSS is a better
 choice in terms of speed and performance.

1.CSS can not locate elements by text where as xpath can
2.no ends-with method in xpath
3.css faster (by finding element than)  xpath
4.css has shortcuts which xpath does not have
5.no advanced CSS
6.CSS has more simple syntax than xpath
========================================Advantages of Using CSS Selectors:==============================================
                                        Faster than XPath
                                        Easier to learn and use than XPath
                                        More likely to find desired item
========================================================================================================================
WebElement Commands:

consists of several methods where we can perform an action anf get the element state on the webpage
isEnabled()-- boolean value
isDisplayed()--boolean value
isSelected()-- boolean value
clear()--void
getText()--String value
getAttribute()--String value
submit()--void

NOTES: How to maximize web page ?
driver.manage().window().maximize();
driver.manage().window().fullscreen();
driver.get(URL); method is used to navigate to particular URL and will wait until page is loaded
driver.navigate.to(URL): method is used to navigate to particular URL and will not wait until the page is loaded and
it maintains the browser history and cookies so we can use forward and backward functions to navigate the between pages
 during execution of scripts.
driver.close(); will close current  window that webdriver is controlling
driver.quit()l will close ALL THE WINDOWS by opened by WebDriver
driver.navigate().back(); is used to navigate page backward
driver.navigate().forward(); is used to navigate page forward
driver.navigate().refresh(); is used to refresh the page
